Headings define the structure of the document. Proper use of heading levels is essential for document generation and navigation.

✅ DOs
* Begin section titles at `##` (Markdown level 2). This is considered Level 1 in MD2HTML.
* Use headings up to `#####` (level 4), with an upper limit of `######` (level 5).
* Use unique titles for each section, figure, and table.

❌ DON'Ts
* Don't use a single # — Level 1 headers (e.g., # Title) are not supported and the MD2HTML tool will fail to build the document.
* Don't go beyond ###### — Level 6 headings and above are ignored in the output.
* Don't duplicate any of the section, figures, or tables titles, as this can disrupt reference links and cause linking issues.
* Don't manually add section, figure, or table numbers — these are generated automatically.

## 📂 Titles
*This is how section `titles` are rendered visually*:

<alert> The MD2HTML tool treats `##` as the top-level heading. Using `#` will break document's PDF/HTML generation.</alert>
✍️ *This is how they are written in Markdown*:

```md
## Title Level 1
### Title Level 2
#### Title Level 3
##### Title Level 4
###### Title Level 5
```

<alert> MD2HTML app supports only heading levels from `##` to `######`, corresponding to Level 1–5 in the rendered document.</alert>

## 🔢 Section Numbers
* Section numbers are automatically generated by the MD2HTML tool and **should not be written manually** in the Markdown source.

## 🅰️ Appendixes

✍️  *After inserting an `appendix title`, subsequent subsections  will be labeled with the `appendix` letter prefix (A, B, C…) by default*:

```md
        ## Appendix title
        ### Subsection heading title
```
*Example*:

**Appendix A. title**

**A.1 Subsection heading title**
