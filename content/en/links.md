The usage of `links` allows us to:

- Reference sections or figures within the same document  
- Connect to other documents or webpages  
- Cross-reference between elements (like tables or appendices)

Correct usage ensures clarity and functionality when exporting to **HTML** or **PDF**, and when working with tools like **MD2HTML**.

## üìò Basics Links
Use this to link to web pages, documentation, or another Markdown file.  

‚úÖ **DOs**
- Use descriptive, meaningful text inside brackets.  
- Use Markdown syntax or angle brackets for external URLs.  
- Add hover **titles** for context when necessary.

‚ùå **DON'Ts**
- Don‚Äôt use vague link text like "click here".
- Avoid using plain URLs without brackets (except inside angle brackets).
- Don‚Äôt repeat formatting unnecessarily (e.g., bold inside bold).

```
**Adding a title to a link (tooltip shown on hover)**: [I'm an inline-style link with a title](https://www.omaspecworks.org/ "OMA Homepage")

‚úçÔ∏è *In Markdown Syntax*:
```md
[I'm an inline-style link with a title](https://www.omaspecworks.org/ "OMA Homepage")
```
**Additional Link Styles** can be used to add emphasis or display links in a code:  
**[Bold Link](https://example.com)**, *[Italic link](https://www.markdownguide.org)*, or [`Link to code`](#markdowncode)

‚úçÔ∏è *Written in Markdown*:
```md
**[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)**
*[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)*
[`Link to code`](#markdowncode)
```
**URLs and Emails** wrapped in angle brackets are automatically rendered as clickable:

## üîó Extended Links
* [To Sections](#to-sections)
* [To Figures](#to-figures)
* [To Tables](#to-tables)
* [External Links](#external-links)

## üìë To Sections
‚úÖ **DOs**
* Use [Section Title]() to create links to sections or subsections.
‚úçÔ∏è *Written in Markdown*:
```md
[Section Title]()
```
* The text inside the square brackets must **exactly match** the section or subsection title.
‚úçÔ∏è *In Markdown*:
```md
    [Device Management & Service Enablement Interface]()
```
*Rendered*: [Device Management & Service Enablement Interface]()  
* Use this syntax only **from the body of the text**, not within HTML tables.
* For special characters like `<` and `>`, use HTML entities like `&lt;` and `&gt;`  
‚úçÔ∏è *Use following*:
```md
[&lt;PROPERTIES&gt;]()
```
*To represent* [&lt;PROPERTIES&gt;]()  
* These links will not work in GitHub & Markdown preview, but they will function correctly in the **HTML** and **PDF** output generated by the **MD2HTML tool** when viewed in a browser.

‚ùå **DON'Ts**
* Don‚Äôt include section/subsection numbers in the link.
* Don‚Äôt write `Appendix` when linking to appendix titles.
* Don‚Äôt use Markdown linking syntax within HTML tables ‚Äî use `<a href="">` instead.

### To Section From Within a Table
‚úÖ DOs

* For links to sections and subsections from within the `HTML` table, use the `HTML` anchor tag:
‚úçÔ∏è *Written in HTML*:
```html
<a href="">Section Title</a>
```
*Rendered*: <a href="">Section Title</a>

* The text must **exactly match** the text of the section/subsection title.

‚ùå DON'Ts

* Don't include the section/subsection number.
* Don't include the word `Appendix` for links to the appendices.
* Don't use this construct for links to a section or subsection in the body of the text.
* The links will not work correctly in GitHub & Markdown. However, the links will work correctly when the `MD2HTML` application generates the `HTML` and `PDF` versions.

## üñºÔ∏è To Figures

‚úÖ **DOs**

* For links to figures from the body of the text, use
‚úçÔ∏è *Markdown syntax*:
```md
[Figure Figure-Title]()
```
*Displayed in the document*: [Figure Figure-Title]()

* Prefix the word Figure to the `Figure-Title`.
* `Figure-Title` = title contained in `<figcaption>`.
* The square brackets enclose the text `Figure` followed by the title; then there are empty round brackets:
‚úçÔ∏è *In Markdown*:
```md
[Figure The protocol stack of the LwM2M Enabler]()
```
*Rendered*: [Figure The protocol stack of the LwM2M Enabler]()

* The `Figure-Title` text between the square brackets must match the figure title's text.

‚ùå **DON'Ts**
* Don't include the figure identifier number.
* Don't use this construct for links to a figure within an `HTML` table.
* The links will not work correctly in GitHub & markdown. However, the links will work correctly when rendered in `HTML` and `PDF`.
* Don't use the word `figure` outside of the parenthesis. Otherwise, the term `figure` will appear duplicated.

‚úçÔ∏è *For example, using Markdown*:
```md
~~figure~~ [Figure The protocol stack of the LwM2M Enabler]()
```
*Rendered*: ~~figure~~ [Figure The protocol stack of the LwM2M Enabler]()

### To Figure From Within a Table

‚úÖ **DOs**

* For links to figures from within an `HTML` table use the `HTML` anchor tag:
  
‚úçÔ∏è *Written in HTML*:
```html
<a href="">Figure Figure-Title</a>
```
*This is how it is displayed*: <a href="">Figure Figure-Title</a>

* Prefix the word `Figure` to the `Figure-Title`.
* `Figure-Title` is the text enclosed by `<figcaption>` tags.

‚úçÔ∏è *For example, using HTML*:
```html
<a href="">Figure Client Registration Interface example flows</a>
```
*This is how it is displayed*: <a href="">Figure Client Registration Interface example flows</a>

* The `Figure-Title` text must match the figure title's text.

‚ùå **DON'Ts**

* Don't include the figure number.
* Don't use this construct for links to a figure in the body of the text.
* The links will not work correctly in GitHub & markdown. However, the links will work correctly in the `HTML` and `PDF` versions.
* Make sure that the word `figure` is not duplicated by adding it inside and outside the anchor.


## üìä To Tables

‚úÖ **DO's**

* For links to a table from the body of the text, 
‚úçÔ∏è *use HTML syntax*:
```md
[Table-Title]()
```
*This is how it is displayed*: [Table-Title]()

* Prefix the word `Table`
* `Table-Title` is the text enclosed by `<caption>` tags

* The square brackets enclose the word `Table` followed by the `Table-Title`; then there are empty round brackets, e.g.:
‚úçÔ∏è *In Markdown*:
```md
[Table Operation to Method and URI Mapping (Registration Interface)]()
```
*Rendered*: [Table Operation to Method and URI Mapping (Registration Interface)]()

* The title text between the square brackets must match the table title's text.

‚ùå **DON'Ts**

* Don't include the table identifier number.
* Don't use this construct for links to a table within an `HTML` table.
* The links will not work correctly in GitHub & Markdown. However, the links will work correctly in the `HTML` and `PDF` versions. 
* The title of the table will contain the word `Table`; make sure it is not duplicated that word.

### To Table From Within Another Table

‚úÖ **DO's**

* For links to tables from within other `HTML` tables, use the `HTML` anchor tag:
‚úçÔ∏è *In HTML*:
```html
<a href="">Table Table-Title</a>
```
*This is how it is displayed*: <a href="">Table Table-Title</a>

* Prefix the world `Table` in front of `Table-Title`.
* `Table-Title` is the text between the `<caption>` tags.

‚úçÔ∏è *For example, using HTML*:
```html
<a href="">Table Object Version usage rules</a>
```
*This is how it is displayed*: <a href="">Table Object Version usage rules</a>

* The `Table-Title` text must match the table title's text.

‚ùå **DON'Ts**

* Don't include the table identifier.
* Don't use this construct for links to a table from the body of the text.
* The links will not work correctly in GitHub & markdown. However, the links will work correctly in the `HTML` and `PDF` versions.
* The title already contains the word  `Table`. So that you know, you don't need to duplicate it outside the anchor.

## üåê To External Links
* For additional link types from within `HTML` tables, use the `HTML` anchor tag:
‚úçÔ∏è *In HTML*:
```html
<a href="http://www.openmobilealliance.org/">URL</a>
```
*This is how it is displayed*: <a href="http://www.openmobilealliance.org/">URL</a>
