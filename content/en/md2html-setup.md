## MD2HTML v2.x
Each Technical document folder MUST include an `index.md` file.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
In MD2HTML version 2.0, the index file format changed from `.md` to `.yaml`.
The old `index.md` file is no longer valid and MUST be replaced with `index.yaml` in the root folder for each document.

üìÑ *Example of an `index.yaml` file for MD2HTML v2.x*:
